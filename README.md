# Model in Azure AI Gallery for ONNX YOLO

## Intro
This repository contains code which demonstrates how to deploy and run AI models using Azure Machine Learning Service.

## How to Use
1. Use [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/Azure-Samples/ai_gallery_yolo_test) to [import the sample notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/Azure-Samples/ai_gallery_yolo_test) into Azure Notebooks.
2. Run the [configuration notebook](src/configuration.ipynb) to create your workspace. 
3. Run the [deployment notebook](src/deploy-onnx-yolo-model.ipynb) to deploy your model and run.
